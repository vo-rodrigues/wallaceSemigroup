    With Corollary \ref{mainexample} in mind, it is natural to ask:
    
    \begin{question}
    Given an uncountable cardinal $\kappa\leq 2^\mathfrak c$, is there a Wallace semigroup $S$ for which $\kappa$ is the smallest cardinal such that $S^\kappa$ is not countably compact? In particular, is there such a semigroup for $\kappa=\omega_1$, $\kappa=\mathfrak c$ or $\kappa=2^{\mathfrak c}$?
    \end{question}

    Due to the restrictions imposed by \cite[Corollary 12, Corollary 14]{T98} and Proposition \ref{restrictionZ}, a natural candidate for the question above is a subsemigroup of $\mathbb Q ^{(\mathfrak c)}$. We note that Bellini, Rodrigues and Tomita  \cite{T21} showed that for every selective ultrafilter $p$, this group admits a $p$-compact group topology, unlike the free Abelian group which cannot have its $\omega$-th power countably compact
    \cite{T98}.

    In \cite{boero2011group}, a Wallace semigroup whose square is countably compact was obtained directly as the subsemigroup $\mathbb N^{(\mathfrak c)}$ with the subspace topology. Naturally, we ask:

    \begin{question}
    Does $\mathbb N^{(\mathfrak c)}$ admits a semigroup topology that makes its finite powers countably compact? Whose third power is countably compact?
    \end{question}
